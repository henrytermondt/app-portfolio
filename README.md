# Project Descriptions
Most projects were coded in JavaScript and are thus stored in HTML files, so you can view them on your browser!

## Quantum Simulation

Simulates the 1D wave function of a particle using the Schr√∂dinger Equation. Accounts for quantum tunneling. This was coded using Python, Matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy.![Quantum Tunneling](https://henrytermondt.github.io/app-portfolio/imgs/quantum.png)

##  Raytracing
Uses matrices and vectors to simulate light in a room. Click <a href='https://henrytermondt.github.io/app-portfolio/raytracer.html' target='_blank'>here</a> to view it. The image gets better over time.

## Graph Editor
Create, edit, and color graphs. Click <a href='https://henrytermondt.github.io/app-portfolio/graph-editor.html' target='_blank'>here</a> to view. Left click to create a new node or to select an already created node, right click on a node to delete it. Click and drag from one node to another to create an edge (you can shape the edge by clicking and dragging on the smaller circles that appear on the edge). While selecting a node, press the 1-4 keys to change its color.

## Marching Cubes
Visualizes a 3D environment and creates triangles using the Marching Cubes algorithm. It uses graph theory to reduce the complexity of the 3D model and uses linear algebra to transform the triangles into the environment. Click <a href='https://henrytermondt.github.io/app-portfolio/marching-cubes.html' target='_blank'>here</a> to view. Use the W, A, S, and D keys to move horizontally, use the shift and space keys to move up and down, and move the mouse to look around.

## Fluid Simulation
Simulates a fluid using the Navier-Stoke Equations. Click <a href='https://henrytermondt.github.io/app-portfolio/fluid-simulation.html' target='_blank'>here</a> and then click and drag the mouse to interact with it, once on the page.

## Reaction-Diffusion
Simulates chemicals interacting using the Gray-Scott model of reaction-diffusion. Click <a href='https://henrytermondt.github.io/app-portfolio/fluid-simulation.html' target='_blank'>here</a> to view a series of reactions.

## Cloth Simulation
Simulates a piece of cloth. The motion of the particles of cloth are simulated using Verlet integration. Click <a href='https://henrytermondt.github.io/app-portfolio/cloth-simulation.html' target='_blank'>here</a> to view. Move the mouse to interact with the cloth.
